# 基本概念

### 倒底什麼是 Empty Set Dollar?

Empty Set Dollar (ESD) 是一种为了满足去中心化金融(DeFi)而生、一种基于演算法且不需要抵押物所生成的稳定币。 並且有以下幾個特點：

- **穩定** - 由於 ESD 是使用演算法來讓價格盡可能地維持在接近 1USDC ，整個過程都是透過協議的運作、利用演算法定時觸發，並透過激勵制度由市場來調節 ESD 代幣本身的價格。

- **可擴展與組合** - 由於 Empty Set Dollar(ESD) 本身依然符合 ERC-20 代幣標準，儘管擁有自動調節的機制在裡面、但它依舊能輕鬆嵌入於各種 DeFi 協議裡面進行交互、抵押，或者參與流動性挖礦。這大大了增加可開發性以及避免掉許多未知的潛在風險。因為它跟其他 ERC20 代幣一模一樣。

- **去中心化** - **沒有預先挖礦、沒有私募、沒有預留任何團隊份額**，Empty Set Dollar 完全是由去中心化的鏈上治理發育而來的。

### How does ESD differ from other stablecoins?

Empty Set Dollar's protocol was designed by taking elements from numerous pre-existing protocols to produce a balanced protocol that avoids the pitfalls of other protocol designs.

The resulting protocol sidesteps the centralisation risks of USDC, USDT, & TUSD, attempts to avoid AMPL & BASED’s "death spirals", the over-collateralisation requirements of sUSD & DAI, and, most importantly, it integrates seamlessly with existing DeFi protocols.

### How does ESD become a sustainably useful token?

For ESD to become a sustainably useful stablecoin like USDT or DAI, it must begin to be accepted as currency by DeFi and other applications on the Ethereum protocol. In periods of volatility, the token's utility may be diminished. However, as the protocol matures the volatility will reduce increasing its utility.

### Who created Empty Set Dollar?

The original founding team is anonymous. However, if you'd like to contact them you can email them here: emptysetsquad@protonmail.com

### Who controls Empty Set Dollar?

Since launch Empty Set Dollar has had on-chain governance. This means that any changes or upgrades to the protocol need to be voted on by the community of token holders before they are enacted.
